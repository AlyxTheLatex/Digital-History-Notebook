Tim Berners-Lee was a "natural" when it come to computers. His parents worked on the Ferranti Mark I, which was the first commercial computer. Tim, though, was the one who had developed a program for himself called Enquire. It stored information in files that had links within them and separate files. This became known as hypertext.
